# MSFS G36 Project version 0.6 - Turbo Patch

This is the improvement project for the MSFS default G36. It all started as a simple edit of some configuration files but it has since grown into a fully-fledged modification that improves all aspects of the default G36 and introduces new features. This package is a patch for Robert Young's excellent turbo-normalized Bonanza mod, which allows you to enjoy the added systems of the Improvement project alongside Robert's work on effects, flight dynamics and the turbo conversion. The Improvement Project was made possible with the help of the community consisting of both enthusiasts and G36 pilots (for a list of contributors, see the end of this readme).

To install: 1: Make sure that Robert's turbo-normalized Bonanza mod is installed

2: Unzip and put the folder 'z-bonanza-g36-improvement-project-turbo-patch' in your MSFS Community folder

3: Download and install the Working Title G1000 v0.3 mod

Important note: make sure that the mod is loaded AFTER the G1000 mod AND Robert's turbo-normalized Bonanza. Mods are loaded in alphabetical order. The release versions therefore have 'z-' at the beginning of the folder name to automatically ensure a correct loading order.
